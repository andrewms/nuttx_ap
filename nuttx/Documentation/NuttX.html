  <td>
    <p>
      The goal is to provide implementations of most standard POSIX OS interfaces
      to support a rich, multi-threaded development environment for deeply embedded
      processors.
    </p>
      NON-GOALS: (1) It is not a goal to provide the level of OS features like those provided by Linux.
      In order to work with smaller MCUs, small footprint must be more important than an extensive feature set.
      But standard compliance is more important than small footprint.
      Surely a smaller RTOS could be produced by ignoring standards.
      Think of NuttX is a tiny Linux work-alike with a much reduced feature set.
      (2) There is no MMU-based support for processes.
      At present, NuttX assumes a flat address space.

    <p>
      NuttX strives to achieve a high degree of standards compliance.
      The primary governing standards are POSIX and ANSI standards.
      Additional standard APIs from Unix and other common RTOS's are
      adopted for functionality not available under these standards
      or for functionality that is not appropriate for the deeply-embedded
      RTOS (such as <code>fork()</code>).
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of this standards conformance, software developed under other
      standard OSs (such as Linux) should port easily to NuttX.

      The philosophy behind that NuttX is that lots of features are great... <i>BUT</i>
      also that if you don't use those features, then you should not have to pay a penalty
      for the unused features.
      And, with NuttX, you don't!  If you don't use a feature, it will not
      be included in the final executable binary.
      You only have to pay the penalty of increased footprint for the features
      that you actually use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using a variety of technologies, NuttX can scale from the very tiny to
      the moderate-size system.  I have executed NuttX with some simple applications
      in as little as 32Kb <i>total</i> memory (code and data).
      On the other hand, typical, richly featured NuttX builds require more like 64Kb
      (and if all of the features are used, this can push 100Kb).

    <p>
      One may be intimidated by the size NuttX source tree.  There are hundreds of source files!
      How can that be a tiny OS?
      Actually, the large number of files is one of the tricks to keep NuttX small and
      as scalable as possible.
      Most files contain only a single function. 
      Sometimes just one tiny function with only a few lines of code.
      Why?
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Static Libraries</b>.
        Because in the NuttX build processed, objects are compiled and saved into
        <i>static libraries</i> (<i>archives</i>).
        Then, when the file executable is linked, only the object files that are needed
        are extracted from the archive and added to the final executable.
        By having many, many tiny source files, you can assure that no code that you do
        not execute is ever included in the link.
        And by having many, tiny source files you have better granularity --
        if you don't use that tiny function of even just a few lines of code, it will
        not be included in the binary.

    <p>
      As mentioned above, the use of many, tiny source files and linking from static
      libraries keeps the size of NuttX down.
      Other tricks used in NuttX include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
         <b>Configuration Files</b>.
         Before you build NuttX, you must provide a configuration file that specifies
         what features you plan to use and which features you do not.
         This configuration file contains a long list of settings that control
         what is built into NuttX and what is not.
         There are hundreds of such settings
         (see the <a href="NuttxPortingGuide.html#apndxconfigs">NuttX Porting Guide</a>
         for a partial list that excludes platform specific settings).
         These many, many configuration options allow NuttX to be highly tuned to
         meet size requirements.
         The downside to all of these configuration options is that it greatly
         complicates the maintenance of NuttX -- but that is my problem, not yours.
      </li>
      <li>
         <b>Weak Symbols</b>
         The GNU toolchain supports <i>weak</i> symbols and these also help to keep
         the size of NuttX down.
         Weak symbols prevent object files from being drawn into the link even if they
         are accessed from source code.
         Careful use of weak symbols is another trick for keep unused code out of the
         final binary.

<h2>NuttX-6.16 Release Notes</h2>
<p>
  The 83<sup>rd</sup> release of NuttX, Version 6.16, was made on March 10, 2012, and is available for download from the
  <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/nuttx/files/">SourceForge</a> website.
  Note that the release consists of two tarballs:  <code>nuttx-6.16.tar.gz</code> and <code>apps-6.16.tar.gz</code>.
  Both may be needed (see the top-level <code>nuttx/README.txt</code> file for build information)
  The change log associated with the release is available <a href="#currentrelease">here</a>.
  Unreleased changes after this release are available in SVN.
  These unreleased changes are also listed <a href="#pendingchanges">here</a>.
</p>

<p><b>New Features</b>.
  New or extended features in this release include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>ARMv7M Support</b>.
    Includes new, streamlined Cortex-M exception handling provided by Mike Smith.
    Context switching support for the Cortex-M4 FPU registers is now provided
    (in both &quot;lazy&quot; and &quot;non-lazy&quot; modes)
  </li>
  <li><b>General Drivers</b>.
    Added a generic &quot;upper half&quot; Quadrature Encoder driver.
    The USB CDC/ACM serial driver can now be dynamically connnected or
    disconnected from the host (programmatically or using NSH commands).
  </li>
  <li><b>STM32 Drivers</b>.
    Added a &quot;lower half&quot; Quadrature Encoder driver.
    Verified the STM32 F4 DMA driver; Added F4 DMA support to the existing STM32 SDIO driver.
  </li>
  <li><b>STM32 Board Support</b>.
    Added support for the STM32 F2 family and for the STM3220G-EVAL board (contributed by Gary Teravskis).
    Support is now included for C++ static constructors (verified using the Atollic toolchain).
    Added support for the SRAM available on the STM3240G-EVAL board.
  </li>
  <li><b>PIC32MX Drivers</b>.
    PIC32MX USB (device) driver is now functional.
    The PIC32MX Ethernet driver not yet fully verified (and an unverified SPI driver is also available).
  </li>
  <li><b>Networking</b>.
    Added a lower-level, thread-independent socket layer.
    Parts of this layer were created in 6.15 to support the FTPD controlling terminal;
    this support has been extended in order to support an NFS file system (not yet released).
  </li>
  <li><b>NuttShell (NSH)</b>.
    NSH will now support a USB serial connection for the console (such as CDC/ACM).
    This is useful in environments where there is no physical serial port on the board.

  </li>
  <li><b>STM32 Drivers</b>.
    Fixed an buffer sizing error in the STM32 Ethernet driver.
  </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Additional Bugfixes</b>.
  Other important bug fixes are listed below.
  See the ChangeLog of a complete, detailed list of bug fixes.
</p>

          This port was extended in NuttX 5.3 with a USB high speed driver contributed by David Hewson.
          David also contributed I2C and SPI drivers plus several important LPC313x USB bug fixes
          that appear in the NuttX 5.6 release.
          This port has been verified using the NuttX OS test, USB serial and mass storage

        <b>STATUS:</b>
          Basic support is in place for both the LPC3152 MCU and the EA3152 board.
          Verification of the port was deferred due to tool issues
          However, because of the high degree of compatibility between the LPC313x and LPC315x family, it
          is very likely that the support is in place (or at least very close).
          At this point, verification of the EA3152 port has been overcome by events and
          may never happen.
          However, the port is available for anyone who may want to use it.

    <p><b>AVR-Specific Issues</b>.
      The basic AVR port is solid and biggest issue for using AVR is its tiny SRAM memory and its Harvard architecture.
      Because of the Harvard architecture, constant data that resides to flash is inaccessible using &quot;normal&quot; memory reads and writes (only SRAM data can be accessed &quot;normally&quot;).
      Special AVR instructions are available for accessing data in FLASH, but these have not been integrated into the normal, general purpose OS.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most NuttX test applications are console-oriented with lots of strings used for printf and debug output.
      These strings are all stored in SRAM now due to these data accessing issues and even the smallest console-oriented applications can quickly fill a 4-8Kb memory.
      So, in order for the AVR port to be useful, one of two things would need to be done:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Don't use console applications that required lots of strings.
        The basic AVR port is solid and your typical deeply embedded application should work fine.
        Or,
      </li>
      <li>
        Create a special version of printf that knows how to access strings that reside in FLASH (or EEPROM).
      </li>
    </ol>

      This port uses the www.mcuzone.com AVRDEV1 board based on the Atmel AT32UC3B0256 MCU.
      This port requires a special GNU avr32 toolchain available from atmel.com website.
      This is a windows native toolchain and so can be used only under Cygwin on Windows.

    <ul>
      <p>
       <b>STATUS:</b>
         This port is has completed all basic development, but there is more that needs to be done.
         All code is complete for the basic NuttX port including header files for all AT32UC3* peripherals.
         The untested AVR32 code was present in the 5.12 release of NuttX.
         Since then, the basic RTOS port has solidified:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The port successfully passes the NuttX OS test (apps/examples/ostest).
        </li>
        <li>
          A NuttShell (NSH) configuration is in place (see the <a href="http://www.nuttx.org/NuttShell.html">NSH User Guide</a>).
          Testing of that configuration has been postponed (because it got bumped by the Olimex LPC1766-STK port).
          Current Status: I think I have a hardware problem with my serial port setup.
          There is a good chance that the NSH port is complete and functional, but I am not yet able to demonstrate that.
          At present, I get nothing coming in the serial RXD line (probably because the pins are configured wrong or I have the MAX232 connected wrong).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The basic, port (including the verified apps/examples/ostest configuration) was be released in NuttX-5.13.
        A complete port will include drivers for additional AVR32 UC3 devices -- like SPI and USB --- and will be available in a later release,
        time permitting.

      Also very usable is the Linux environment using the

      The SDCC compiler provides support for the 8051/2, z80, hc08, and other microcontrollers.
      The SDCC-based logic is less well exercised and you will likely find some compilation

  </td>

<tr>

    <p>
      This is a tougher environment.
      In this case, the Windows native toolchain is unaware of the
      Cygwin <i>sandbox</i> and, instead, operates in the native Windows environment.
      The primary difficulties with this are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Paths</b>.
        Full paths for the native toolchain must follow Windows standards.
        For example, the path <code>/home/my\ name/nuttx/include</code> my have to be
        converted to something like <code>'C:\cygwin\home\my name\nuttx\include'</code>
        to be usable by the toolchain.
      </li>
      <p>
        Fortunately, this conversion is done simply using the <code>cygpath</code> utility.
      </p>
      <li>
        <b>Symbolic Links</b>
        NuttX depends on symbolic links to install platform-specific directories in the build system.
        On Linux, true symbolic links are used.
        On Cygwin, emulated symbolic links are used.
        Unfortunately, for native Windows applications that operate outside of the
        Cygwin <i>sandbox</i>, these symbolic links cannot be used.
      </li>
      <p>
        The NuttX make system works around this limitation by copying the platform
        specific directories in place.
        These copied directories make work a little more complex, but otherwise work well.
      </p>
      <p><small>
        NOTE: In this environment, it should be possible to use the NTFS <code>mklink</code> command to create links.
        This should only require a minor modification to the build scripts (see <code>tools/winlink.sh</code> script).
      </small></p>
      <li>
        <b>Dependencies</b>
        NuttX uses the GCC compiler's <code>-M</code> option to generate make dependencies.  These
        dependencies are retained in files called <code>Make.deps</code> throughout the system.
        For compilers other than GCC, there is no support for making dependencies in this way.
        For Windows native GCC compilers, the generated dependencies are windows paths and not
        directly usable in the Cygwin make.  By default, dependencies are surpressed for these
        compilers as well.
      </li>
      <p><small>
        NOTE: dependencies are suppress by setting the make variable <code>MKDEPS</code> to point
        to the do-nothing dependency script, <code>tools/mknulldeps.sh</code>.
        Dependencies can be enabled for the Windows native GCC compilers by setting
        <code>MKDEPS</code> to point to <code>$(TOPDIR)/tools/mkdeps.sh --winpaths $(TOPDIR)</code>.
      </small></p>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b>Supported Windows Native Toolchains</b>.
      At present, only the Zilog Z16F, z8Encore, and eZ80Acclaim ports use a non-GCC native Windows
      toolchain(the Zilog ZDS-II toolchain).
      Support for Windows native GCC toolchains (CodeSourcery and devkitARM) is currently implemented
      for the NXP LPC214x, STMicro STR71x, and Luminary LMS6918 ARM ports.
      (but could easily be extended to any other GCC-based platform with a small effort).

      I've never tried this one, but I off the following reported by an ez80 user using the ZiLOG ZDS-II Windows-native toolchain:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
         &quot;I've installed ZDS-II 5.1.1 (IDE for ez80-based boards) on wine (windows emulator for UNIX) and to my surprise, not many changes were needed to make SVN snapshot of Nuttx buildable...
         I've tried nsh profile and build process completed successfully.
         One remark is necessary: Nuttx makefiles for ez80 are referencing <code>cygpath</code> utility.
         Wine provides similar thing called <code>winepath</code> which is compatible and offers compatible syntax.
         To use that, <code>winepath</code> (which itself is a shell script) has to be copied as <code>cygpath</code> somewhere in <code>$PATH</code>, and edited as in following patch:
       </p>
       <ul><pre>

</pre></ul>
      <p>
        &quot;Better solution would be replacing all <code>cygpath</code> references in  <code>Makefiles </code> with  <code>$(CONVPATH)</code> (or  <code>${CONVPATH}</code> in shell scripts) and setting <code>CONVPATH</code> to  <code>cygpath</code> or  <code>winepath</code> regarding to currently used environment.

      <b>Environment Dependencies</b>.
      The primary environmental dependency of NuttX are (1) GNU make,
      (2) bash scripting, and (3) Linux utilities (such as cat, sed, etc.).
      If you have other platforms that support GNU make or make
      utilities that are compatible with GNU make, then it is very
      likely that NuttX would work in that environment as well (with some
      porting effort). If GNU make is not supported, then some significant
      modification of the Make system would be required.
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>GNUWin32</b>.
      For example, with suitable make system changes, it should be possible to
      use native GNU tools (such as those from
      <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuwin32/">GNUWin32</a>)
      to build NuttX.
      However, that environment has not been used as of this writing.
   </p>
      <p><small>
        NOTE: One of the members on the <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/nuttx/">NuttX forum</a>
        reported that they successful built NuttX using such a GNUWin32-based, Windows native environment.
        They reported that the only necessary change was to the use the NTFS mklink command to create links
        (see <code>tools/winlink.sh</code> script).

nuttx-6.16 2012-03-10 Gregory Nutt &lt;gnutt@nuttx.org&gt;

    * drivers/sensors/qencoder.c and include/nuttx/sensors/qencoder.h:  Add an
      implementation for a quadrature encoder upper half driver.
    * arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_qencoder.c/.h:  Add a initial implementation of
      a lower-half quadrature encoder driver for the STM32.  On initial check-in,
      this is little more than a &quot;skeleton&quot; file.
    * Various files:  CAN ISO-11783 support contributed by Gary Teravskis.
    * net/recv.c and net/recvfrom.c: Correct a bug in return value:  The the peer
      gracefully closes the connections, needs to return zero and not ENOTCONN.
    * arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_eth.c:  Fix an error in the STM32 ethernet driver.
      The received buffer size must be two bytes larger to account for the two byte
      checksum that is appended to the packet.  Otherwise, the last two bytes of
      real data in the packet will get clobbered.
    * arch/arm/src/stm32f40xx_dma.c:  The STM32 F4 DMA has (finally) been verified
    * arch/arm/src/stm32_sdio.c:  STM32 F4 SDIO DMA is now supported
    * configs/stm3240g-eval/nsh/defconfig: This configuration now supports SDIO
      with DMA (see configs/stm3240g-eval/README.txt for some issues).
    * arch/arm/src/armv7-m/up_vectors.S and arch/arm/src/armv7-m/up_vectors.S:  New,
      streamlined Cortex-M exception handling (with FPU supported).  Contributed byh
      Mike Smith
    * net/accept.c, connect.c,and net_monitor.c:  Correct an error in the accept
      logic.  After a new connection is made via accept(), monitoring for losses
      of TCP connection must be set up (just as with connect()).  The new file
      net_monitor.c holds the common TCP connection monitoring logic used by both
      the accecpt() and connect() logic.  Contributed by Max Nekludov.
    * net/recvfrom.c and net/uip/uip_tcpcallback.c:  Fix a leak in the TCP
      read-ahead logic.  This is a *critical* bug fix!
    * net/uip/uip_tcpinput.c:  Correct an error in the TCP stack.  It was
      incrementing the received sequence number BEFORE determining if the
      incoming data could be handled.  If the data was dropped (usually because
      there is insufficient buffering space), then no ACK will be sent and the
      sequence number will be wrong.  The end consequence of the bad sequence
      number was that the when the dropped packet was re-transmitted, it was
      was ignored because its sequence number looked wrong.  Fix was, obviously,
      to only increment the recevied sequence number if the TCP data was
      accepted.
    * configs/stm3240g-eval, configs/stm32f40discovery, and arch/*/src/Makefile:
      Add changes to support building with the Atollic &quot;Lite&quot; toolchain.
    * fs/fs_select.c:  Correct select(), in the case of loss of network
      connection (POLLHUP), select() must report a read-ready event.  This
      is how the standard select() interface is supposed to work:  In the case
      of loss-of-connection, select() reports read-ready.  The next time you
      read from the socket, you detect the end-of-connection event.  Change
      submitted by Max Nekludov.
    * arch/arm/src/armv7-m/up_fpu.S and arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_vectors.S:  Fix
      lazy FPU register saving with CONFIG_ARCH_FPU is set in the configuration.
    * arch/arm/src/armv7-m:  Lazy saving of floating point registers on context
      switches now seems to be functional.
    * net/uip/uip_tcpinput.c:  Fix a TCP protocol error reported by Max Nekludov.
    * configs/stm3240g-eval, configs/stm32f40discovery:  Add changes to support
      building with the Atollic &quot;Pro&quot; toolchain.
    * Makefile:  Use the more common .hex extension for Intel hex files instead of
      more precise .ihx extension.  This change has ripple effects to many build-
      related scripts and programs and could cause some short-term problems.
    * configs/stm3240g-eval/, arch/arm/src/stm32/up_allocateheap.c:  Add support
      for the 16-mbit SRAM on-board the STM3240G-EVAL board.
    * drivers/usbdev/cdcacm.c and include/nuttx/usbdev/cdcacm.h:  The CDC/ACM
      driver can now be dynamically connected and disconnected from the host
      under software control.
    * include/nuttx/arch.h, configs/stm3240g-eval/src/up_cxxinitialize.c, and
      configs/stm3240g-eval/src/up_cxxinitialize.c:  Add support for C++ static
      initializers.
    * net/setsockopt.c, net/getsockopt.c, net/bind.c, net/socket.c:  Add more
      low level, thread-independent socket interfaces for use within the OS.
      Some of these are currently used by the FTP controlling terminal.  More will
      be used to support the NFS file system currenly underwork.
    * include/nuttx/net/:  Major re-organization of networking headerf files.
      Moved all non-standard, NuttX-specific header files from include/net and
      include/nuttx into include/nuttx/net.
    * arch/mips/src/pic32mx/pic32mx_usbdev.c:  The PIC32 USB driver now appears to
      be fully functional.
    * configs/sure-pic32mx/usbnsh and configs/sure-pic32mx/src:  Add support for
      NSH using only USB serial I/O to support the console.  This is useful on
      devices that have USB, but no serial port.
    * arch/mips/src/pic32mx/pic32mx_spi.c:  Add a PIC32 SPI driver.  Initial
      checkin is primitive, incomplete (lacks interrupt logic), and untested.
    * configs/pic32-startkit/nsh:  Completed verification of the PIC32 Ethernet
      Starter Kit port.  Added and verified the NuttShell (NSH) on the PIC32
      Ethernet Starter Kit.  I can now (finally) claim to have complete the
      basic port to this board.
    * configs/pic32-startkit/nsh/up_usbdev, up_nsh.c, and up_usbterm.c:  Verified
      the USB (device) driver on the PIC32 Ethernet Starter Kit.
    * arch/mips/src/pic32mx/pic32mx_ethernet.c:  Verifed the PIC32 Ethernet
      driver on the PIC32 Starter Kit.  Status:  It is occasionally functional
      but no stable enough for use.
    * arch/arm/include/stm32, arch/arm/src/stm32:  Add general support for
      the STM32 F2 family. Contributed by Gary Teravskis,
    * configs/stm3220g-eval:  Add support for the STMicro STM3220G-EVAL board.
      Contributed by Gary Teravskis,

apps-6.16 2012-03-10 Gregory Nutt &lt;gnutt@nuttx.org&gt;

    * apps/examples/qencoder:  Add a quadrature driver test.
    * apps/examples/ostest/fpu.c:  Add a test to verify that FPU registers
      are properly saved and restored on context switches.
    * apps/system/readline/readline.c:  readline() will now treat either a
      backspace or a DEL character as a backspace (i.e., deleting the character
      to the left of the cursor).  This makes NSH less dependent on particular
      keyboard mappings of the Backspace key.  Submitted by Mike Smith.
    * apps/examples/cdcacm:  An example that illustrates how the CDC/ACM driver
      may to connected and disconnected through software control.
    * apps/examples/nsh/nsh_main.c:  If available, call up_cxxinitialize() to
      initialize all statically defined C++ classes.
    * apps/nshlib:  Now supports a USB serial device for NSH console I/O.  This
      allows NSH to be used on boards that have USB but no serial connectors.

pascal-1.0 2011-05-15 Gregory Nutt &lt;gnutt@nuttx.org&gt;

    * nuttx/:  The Pascal add-on module now installs and builds under the
      apps/interpreters directory.  This means that the pascal-2.1 module is
      incompatible with will all releases of NuttX prior to nuttx-6.0 where the 
      apps/ module was introduced.

buildroot-1.10 2011-05-06 &lt;gnutt@nuttx.org&gt;

    * Add patch submitted by Dimiter Georgiev to work around problems in building
      GDB 6.8 with versions of Cygwin &gt; 1.7.
    * configs/i486-defconfig-4.3.3 - Builds an i486 cross development toolchain
      using gcc 4.3.3.  Why wouldyou want such a thing?  On Linux, of course,
      such a thing is not needed because you can use the installed GCC to build
      i486 ELF binaries.  But that will not work under Cygwin!  The Cygwin
      toolchain (and probably MinGW), build DOS MZ format executables (i.e.,
      .exe files).  That is probably not usable for most NuttX targets.
      Instead, you should use this i486-elf-gcc to generate true ELF binaries
      under Cygwin.
    * Makefile - Alter copy arguments to avoid permissions problems when
      copying NuttX header files.
    * toolchain/nxflat/nxflat.mk and Makefile - Fix include paths.
    * toolchain/gcc/3.3.6 - Added a patch to fixed compilation error on Ubuntu
      9.10.
    * toolchain/nxflat/Makefile - Correct static library link order.
